\section{Data}
The Data section (indicative length : 1 page) should provide a deep analysis of the data used for experiment. In particular, we are interested here in your capacity to provide relevant and thoughtful feedbacks on the data and to demonstrate that you master some "data diagnosis" tools that have been dealt with in the lectures/tutorials.
