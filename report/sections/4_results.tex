\section{Results}

The Result section (indicative length : 1 to 2 pages) \textbf{should display numerical simulations on real time series} (even if the original article was focused on images). If you re-used some existing implementations, it is expected that this section develops new experiments that were not present in the original article. Results should be discussed not only based on quantative scores but also on qualitative aspects. In particular (especially if your article focuses on black box methods), please provide some feedbacks whether the method was adapted to the data or not and whether the hypothesis behind the approach you used were validated or not.
