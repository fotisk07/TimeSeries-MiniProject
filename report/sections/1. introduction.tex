\section{Introduction and contributions}

The Introduction section (indicative length : less than 1 page) should detail the scientific context of the article you chose, as well as the task that you want to solve (especially if you apply it on novel data). \textbf{The last paragraph of the introduction must contain the following information}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Repartition of work between the two students
    \item Use of available source code or not, percentage of the source code that has been reused, etc.
    \item Use of existing experiments or new experiments (e.g. test of the influence of parameter that was not conducted in the original article, application of the method on a novel task/data set etc.)
    \item Improvement on the original method (e.g. new pre/post processing steps, grid search for optimal parameters etc.)
\end{itemize}
