% \paragraph{What is expected for these mini-projects?}
% The goal of the exercise is to read (and understand) a research article, implement it (or find an implementation), test it on real data and comment on the results obtained.
% Depending on the articles, the task will not always be the same: some articles are more theoretical or complex, others are in the direct line of the course, etc... It is therefore important to balance the exercise according to the article. For example, if you have reused an existing implementation, it is obvious that you will have to develop in a more detailed way the analysis of the results, the influence of the parameters etc... Do not hesitate to contact us by email if you wish to be guided.

% \paragraph{The report}
%  The report must be at most FIVE pages and use this template (excluding references). If needed, additional images and tables can be put in Appendix, but must be discussed in the main document. The report must contain a precise description of the work done, a description of the method, and the results of your tests. Please do not include source code! The report must clearly show the elements that you have done yourself and those that you have reused only, as well as the distribution of tasks within the team (see detailed plan below.)
%  
%  \paragraph{The source code}
% In addition to this report, you will have to send us a Python notebook allowing to launch the code and to test it on data. For the data, you can find it on standard sites like Kaggle, or the site https://timeseriesclassification.com/ which contains a lot of signals!

% \paragraph{The oral presentations}
% They will last 10 minutes followed by 5 minutes of questions. The plan of the defense is the same as the one of the report: presentation of the work done, description of the method and analysis of the results.
