# Progress Notes


## First Session

### Preparatory Notes

Paper identifies player roles and formations using a 2 step approach based on change point detection.

Pipeline : 
1) Identify role positions using another Paper
2)
	a) Form CPD in each half -> Gives segments of same formation
	b) Role CPD in each segment -> Gives player positions (detecting changes)

Suggested Method : 
1) Each one investigates more in detail one method, while vaguely reading and understanding the other one
2) Next week start deciding on experiments to run and testing them
